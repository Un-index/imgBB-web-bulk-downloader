The last and quickest to use of the 3 imgBB utilities I've created to bulk download images from the site.

Simply :

* visit the imgBB upload page
* copy the urls
* paste them in the textbox on https://un-index.github.io/imgBB-web-bulk-downloader/

Hit download and it will download the urls. In case your browser warns you of the site downloading multiple urls, allow it by clicking the button in the popup that appears.
